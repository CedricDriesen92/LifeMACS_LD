Damage Topology Ontology: Descriptionback to ToC
When a damage instance is defined using DOT, exactly three direct subclasses of dot:Damage should be related to the damage instance. First, a damage topology class has to be selected (dot:DamageElement or dot:DamageArea). Secondly, the kind of damage can be defined using either dot:UnclassifiedDamage or subclasses of dot:ClassifiedDamage that are defined in DOT extensions. Finally, a certain damage instance can impair the structural integrity (dot:StructuralDamage) or it does not relate to the structural capacities of the element (dot:Defect).

Classified Damagecback to ToC or Class ToC
IRI: https://w3id.org/dot#ClassifiedDamage

Damagecback to ToC or Class ToC
IRI: https://w3id.org/dot#Damage

Damage is the harm to a structure resulting in impairment or loss of function, usefulness or value. Instead of using dot:Damage, it is recommended to use one subclass of dot:Damage for respectively the damage topology (either dot:DamageArea or dot:DamageElement), the potential structural impact (either dot:StructuralDamage or dot:Defect) and the damage classification (either dot:UnclassifiedDamage or subclasses of dot:ClassifiedDamage).
